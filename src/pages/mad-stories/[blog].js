                Landing a full-time job in the UK is a pure persevearnace play. Itâ€™s okay if you are rejected a 1000 times, but you need to get selected only once. <br/> <br/>
                Sharath Leelakrishnan here, obviously thatâ€™s a long Indian name and didnâ€™t really go well in the UK. So it became Shaki. <br/> <br/>
                On September 9th 2021, I entered the UK with 2 suitcases, 400 pounds and a lot of dreams and hopes but with a very specific mission of making it out.  <br/><br/>
                Unlike most of you I didnâ€™t come here to study, I came here to crack a job here that would help earn in pounds. Didnâ€™t really care which domain I am cracking in.  <br/><br/>
                I tried multiple domains like Software Engineering, Cybersecurity, also tried Quant Financing for a bit just to later realize that none of them would work for me.  <br/> <br/>
                6 months passed in this mess and this is the time I started freaking out. So I decided Iâ€™ll fix one role and channel all my time and focus mastering a specific role.  <br/><br/>
                That was exactly the time when Cryptocurrencies, NFTs were on the rise. I started reading more on it.  <br/><br/>
                I felt it was super interesting and from that point on I lived my life with one motive which is to crack a full-time job in web3.  <br/><br/>
                I was able to understand the tech and a lot of people were struggling to uncover the same. <br/><br/>
                So I decided to start a campaign called, #Learnweb3in60days breaking down crucial web3 concepts each day.  <br/><br/>
                After 1 week of posting content, I got a 1-month freelance contract for 1000 pounds.  <br/><br/>
                This is the time when it became addiction. I started posting more content, connecting with more people and tried to build an authentic profile. <br/><br/>
                In 60 days, I started receiving interviews. I obviously didnâ€™t crack it in the 1st interview. <br/><br/>
                It took sometime, eventually I was able to crack a remote-full time job in the UK. <br/><br/>
                Trust me, that was one of the biggest wins in my life so far. I got that offer exactly on the last day of my Uni and it gave me a mad story to tell. <br/><br/>
                I then decided why not help my close friends have a mad story as well. I was quite successful at that. <br/><br/>
                We came together and decided why not help every student pursuing masters abroad have their own Mad Story. <br/><br/>
                Unimad was born. You having a mad story is our mad story. I am not saying itâ€™s easy, all I am saying is itâ€™s fucking worth it. <br/><br/>
                We are on a mission to create a million mad stories.  <br/><br/>
                You getting a job here is GREATNESS. You helping 1000s of other students get a job, thatâ€™s MADNESS.  <br/><br/>
                In our opinion MADNESS { '>>>>' } GREATNESS <br/><br/>
                Mad Life Mad Vibes ðŸ¤Ÿ <br/><br/>
